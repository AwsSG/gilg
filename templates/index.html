            What is The Epic of Gilgamesh is all about?
        </h2>

        <p class="post-meta">
            Death is an inevitable and inescapable fact of human life, which is the greatest lesson Gilgamesh (in sumerian languege: ð’€­ð’„‘ð’‰‹ð’‚µð’ˆ¨ð’Œ‹ð’Œ‹ð’Œ‹) learns. Gilgamesh is bitter that only the gods can live forever and says as much when Enkidu warns him away when fighting with Humbaba that "Life is short"
